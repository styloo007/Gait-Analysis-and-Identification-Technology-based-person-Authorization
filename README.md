1. **Introduction**: 
   - Gait analysis and identification technology refers to the process of recognizing individuals based on their unique walking patterns or gaits.
   - This technology utilizes various sensors and algorithms to analyze and identify individuals, offering a non-intrusive and efficient method of authentication.

2. **Gait Analysis**:
   - Gait analysis involves the measurement, assessment, and interpretation of an individual's walking pattern.
   - It considers parameters such as stride length, stride duration, step width, foot angle, and other biomechanical characteristics.

3. **Identification Technology**:
   - Identification technology encompasses the hardware and software components used to capture and analyze gait patterns.
   - This may include specialized cameras, depth sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and machine learning algorithms.

4. **Authentication Process**:
   - The authentication process begins with capturing the gait pattern of an individual either through wearable sensors or surveillance systems.
   - The captured data is then processed using algorithms that extract unique features from the gait pattern.
   - These features are compared against a database of known gait patterns to determine the identity of the individual.

5. **Advantages**:
   - Non-intrusive: Gait analysis technology does not require physical contact with the individual, making it suitable for remote authentication.
   - Difficult to spoof: Gait patterns are unique to individuals and are difficult to imitate or spoof, enhancing security.
   - Continuous authentication: Gait analysis can be performed continuously, providing ongoing verification of identity without the need for repeated authentication.

6. **Applications**:
   - Security and access control: Gait analysis technology can be used for secure access to buildings, facilities, and computer systems.
   - Law enforcement: Gait analysis can aid in forensic investigations by identifying individuals captured in surveillance footage.
   - Healthcare: Gait analysis technology can be used for monitoring and assessing mobility in patients with neurological or musculoskeletal conditions.

7. **Challenges**:
   - Environmental factors: Variations in terrain, lighting conditions, and clothing can affect the accuracy of gait analysis.
   - Privacy concerns: The collection and storage of biometric data raise privacy concerns regarding its use and potential misuse.
   - User acceptance: Acceptance of gait analysis technology may vary among individuals due to cultural, ethical, and psychological factors.

8. **Future Directions**:
   - Integration with other biometric modalities: Gait analysis technology may be integrated with other biometric modalities such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning for enhanced authentication.
   - Improved accuracy: Ongoing research aims to improve the accuracy and robustness of gait analysis algorithms, particularly in challenging real-world conditions.
   - Expansion of applications: Gait analysis technology is likely to find applications in a broader range of industries, including retail, transportation, and entertainment.

Overall, Gait Analysis and Identification Technology-based Person Authorization offers a promising approach to authentication, combining the uniqueness of gait patterns with the efficiency of automated recognition systems.

To train the model, just change the Dataset path in the gaitdetection.ipynb. After the model is trained, replace the path of model in Django view with new path.

```bash
cd gaitUI

py manage.py runserver
